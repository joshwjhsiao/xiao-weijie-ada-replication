Description of the original paper

The original paper aims to test the effects of vowel and onset consonant lengthening on segmentation; namely, listeners’ ability to use vowel lengthening and onset consonant lengthening in human conversation as cues to word-finality and word-initiality. The original paper used experiment I (N = 150) with five conditions and experiment II (N = 30) with one condition to examine the effects through Bayesian analysis methods. The two experiments' results supported the prediction that both word-final vowel lengthening and word-initial onset consonant lengthening improves the listeners’ segmentation.

Definitions of variable names

In experiment I, five conditions were used to test participant accuracy rates including no lengthening (NL), final vowel lengthening (FVL), initial onset consonant lengthening (IOL), initial vowel lengthening (IVL), and final onset consonant lengthening (FOL) (p.1869). In experiment II, one condition was used to test participant accuracy rates: initial onset consonant plus final vowel lengthening (IOþFVL) (p. 1872).

The reanalysis outline

In this replication assignment, I used both data from two experiments of the original paper. I replicated (1) a descriptive analysis of the demographics of two experiment participants (sex, mean age, SD, and range), (2) two visualizations including the accuracy rates of responses and the marginal posterior distributions of the fixed effect parameters in experiment II, and (3) an inferential analysis of experiment II using a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression model.

Discussion and reflection

The replication results are pretty successful: (1) the descriptive analysis of the demographics of two experiment participants are the same as the original paper, (2) two visualizations including the accuracy rates of responses and the marginal posterior distributions of the fixed effect parameters in experiment II are closely similar to the original ones, and (3) the replication and the original inferential analysis of experiment II using a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression model are also alike.

While the data I obtained from the original datasets are quite complete, the whole process of doing this replication work was full of challenges. First, the data visualization was nearly impossible to replicate completely the same presentation without the authors’ description of the size, color, themes, and other details. I had to repeatedly try different functions and discuss with my peers to speculate the possible style. Second, running a Bayesian analysis requires not only coding knowledge but also needs enough computer capacity. I have spent hours sorting out my Windows system's compatibility problems of running the code by searching across different R-related forums. It turned out that many Windows system users have experienced similar program compilation issues. I had to use a Mac laptop to run the analysis instead.         

While the replication has similar results to the original ones, there are still some slight differences because of the limited data processing description. Luckily, some important steps are addressed in the original paper, including the packages and functions used as well as the data exclusion process. For example, I followed closely the author’s data preprocessing steps: “responses in the test phase were analyzed and
time-outs (0.6% of all data of experiment II) were discarded (p.1872).” Also, I read through the article to follow nearly the same steps as the author did, such as setting the same prior applied to the fixed-effect parameters (e.g., p. 1871). Of course, there is still a possibility of inconsistency caused by the seed and iter setting in the model, leading to unsatisfactory replication results.
